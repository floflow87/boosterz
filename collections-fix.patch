JSX Syntax Fix for collections.tsx

The issue is with the conditional rendering structure around line 1531.
The IIFE pattern is causing TypeScript parsing errors.

Current problematic structure:
```jsx
              {(() => {
                return (
                  <div>
                    // content
                  </div>
                );
              })()}
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
```

The issue is that the IIFE is not properly closed within the JSX conditional structure.
